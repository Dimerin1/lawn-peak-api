</script>
```

### Framer Web Specific Requirements

   - Each component must be self-contained in a single code block
   - No external dependencies or imports outside Stripe and Google Maps
   - All styles must be inline or in the component

2. **State Management**
   - Use React.useState for local state
   - Pass data between steps using Framer's built-in connections
   - Store sensitive data only in memory, never in localStorage

3. **Integration Points**
   - Step 1 → Step 2: Pass customer name
   - Step 2 → Step 3: Pass address, lot size, service type, and calculated price
   - Step 3: Handle payment and submit order

4. **Styling Guidelines**

   - Match existing UI components
   - Maintain consistent spacing and colors
   - Support both light and dark modes

5. **Error Handling**

## Framer Web Connections Setup

### Connecting QuoteCalculator to PaymentForm

1. **Setup Variables in QuoteCalculator**
   ```typescript
   // In QuoteCalculator, expose these variables:
   const [formData, setFormData] = React.useState({
     price: 0,
     service: "ONE_TIME",
     // ... other fields
   })
   ```

2. **Framer Web Connection Steps**
   1. Open your Framer project
   2. Select the PaymentForm component on the canvas
   3. In the right sidebar, click "Code" tab
   4. Under "Properties", you'll see:
      - `price` (number)
      - `serviceType` (enum)
   
   5. Click "Connect" next to each property:
      ```
      price → QuoteCalculator.formData.price
      serviceType → QuoteCalculator.formData.service
      ```

3. **Overrides in QuoteCalculator**
   ```typescript
   // Add these overrides to expose the state:
   QuoteCalculator.defaultProps = {
     price: 0,
     serviceType: "ONE_TIME"
   }

   addPropertyControls(QuoteCalculator, {
     onPriceChange: {
       type: ControlType.EventHandler
     },
     onServiceChange: {
       type: ControlType.EventHandler
     }
   })
   ```

4. **Testing the Connection**
   1. In Preview mode:
      - Fill out Step 1 (Name)
      - In Step 2:
         - Select a lot size
         - Choose a service type
      - The price should automatically update in Step 3

### Troubleshooting Connections
If the price isn't updating:
1. Check the Console (⌘+Option+I or Ctrl+Shift+I)
2. Verify that QuoteCalculator is emitting price changes
3. Verify PaymentForm is receiving price updates

### Best Practices
1. Always use the `formData.price` from QuoteCalculator as the source of truth
2. Don't modify the price in PaymentForm
3. Handle loading states while price is being calculated

## Next Steps

1. Test payment flow with live keys in production
2. Monitor customer data in Google Sheets
3. Consider adding email notifications for new quotes
4. Add analytics tracking for form completion rates
5. Add success and cancel pages for post-payment flow
6. Implement email notifications for new orders
7. Add analytics tracking
8. Set up automated testing for critical paths
9. Improve mobile responsiveness
10. Add customer search and filtering in Admin Dashboard
11. Implement batch operations for customer management
